Fashion X-ray is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance your fashion experience through cutting-edge AI technologies. It comprises three main components:

Fashion Detector: Detects fashion objects in a video using the YOLOv8 model.

Style Recommender: Allows users to upload images of any clothing apparel and displays similar products using CNN and KNN models.

Virtual Try-On: Enables users to virtually try on clothes.

Fashion X-ray integrates advanced machine learning models to provide a seamless fashion experience. From detecting fashion items in videos to recommending similar products and allowing virtual try-ons, this project aims to revolutionize the way you interact with fashion.

### Features

#### Fashion Detector

The Fashion Detector utilizes the YOLOv8 model to identify fashion items in videos. This component can detect various clothing and accessories, making it a powerful tool for fashion analysis.
